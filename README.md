## Description

This application is a voting system for bus mall. Bus mall is a business that distributes bus mall magazines into the back seat pouches of public bus transportation. In order to determine what kinda of products that bus mall will feature in their magazine, they need to have users come to this website and vote on which products they would like to see more. The voting system works by displaying three images at a time out of a pool of 20 images. There are 25 rounds and the user must click on their favorite photo of the three in order to advance to the sequential round. Upon 25 completed rounds, a chart will be generated that will display the voting results.
